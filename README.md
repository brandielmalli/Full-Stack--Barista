I created an application that allows a coffee house to handle incoming orders, enables the cashier to enter the customer's name and their order. The order is sent to a queue that the baristas can see and give them the ability to mark an order complete. The app then automatically says the customer's name out loud when an order is complete and which barista completed the order.
